                <h1>A group of stem-passionate students takes on the tech challenge.</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>A few days before the challenge was over, when we were finishing up our testing process, we asked ourselves why we spent so much time on this in the first place. All of us are passionate about STEM in our own right. Sohan is a team captain of the robotics team at his high school. Adiyan participates every year in the Synopsis Science Fair. Yash J is part of the school physics interest club. Sudarshan and Joseph are both self-title tinkerers and love messing with hardware in their respective garages. And each one of us has one thing in common. We love building things. And that’s why we are here.</p>

                        <h3>Lift</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Airfoil: streamlined shape capable of generating significantly more lift than drag (a cross-section of a
wing defines an airfoil shape)
Lift: Essentially, upward force on a body generated in a fluid environment
An airfoil generates lift by exerting a downward force on the air as it flows past. According to Newton's third law, the air must exert an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is the lift.
The air flow changes direction as it passes
the airfoil and follows a path that is curved
downward. According to Newton's second
law, this change in flow direction requires a downward force applied to the air by the airfoil. Then, according to Newton's third law, the air must exert an upward force on the airfoil. The overall result is that a reaction force, the lift, is generated opposite to the directional change. In the case of an airplane wing, the wing exerts a downward force on the air and the air exerts an upward force on the wing.</p>

                        <h3>Drag</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Drag: An aerodynamic force that opposes an aircraft’s motion through the air. Drag is generated by every part of the glider.
 Drag is a mechanical force. It is generated by the interaction and contact of a solid body with a fluid (liquid or gas). We can think of drag as essentially aerodynamic friction, and much drag is actually caused by the surface skin friction between the air and the body and wings of the glider.
There is also an additional drag component caused by the generation of lift, which is called induced
drag. Essentially, this drag is caused by the pressure difference of lift generated across the wing of a glider. Thin wings tend to have a smaller induced drag, and shorter, larger wings, have a larger induced drag.

                        <h3>Thrust</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Thrust: Thrust is the force which moves an aircraft through the air. Thrust is used to overcome the drag of an airplane.
Thrust is a mechanical force, so the propulsion system must be in physical contact with a working fluid to produce thrust. Thrust is generated most often through the reaction of accelerating a mass of gas. Since thrust is a force, it is a vector quantity having both a magnitude and a direction. The engine does work on the gas and accelerates the gas to the rear of the engine; the thrust is generated in the opposite direction from the accelerated gas. The magnitude of the thrust depends on the amount of gas that is accelerated and on the difference in velocity of the gas through the engine.

                        <h3>Weight</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">We are more familiar with weight than with the other forces acting on an airplane, because each of us have our own weight which we can measure every morning on the bathroom scale. We know when one thing is heavy and when another thing is light. But weight, the gravitational force, is fundamentally different from the aerodynamic forces, lift and drag. Aerodynamic forces are mechanical forces and the airplane has to be in physical contact with the the air which generates the force. The gravitational force is a field force; the source of the force does not have to be in physical contact with the object to generate a pull on the object.

Weight is a force, and a force is a vector quantity having both a magnitude and a direction associated with it. For an airplane, weight is always directed towards the center of the earth. The magnitude of this force depends on the mass of all of the parts of the airplane itself, plus the amount of fuel, plus any payload on board (people, baggage, freight, ...). The weight is distributed throughout the airplane, but we can often think of it as collected and acting through a single point called the center of gravity. In flight, the airplane rotates about the center of gravity, but the direction of the weight force always
remains toward the center of the earth. During a flight the aircraft burns up its fuel, so the weight of the airplane constantly changes. Also, the distribution of the weight and the center of gravity can change, so the pilot must constantly adjust the controls to keep the airplane balanced.
Flying involves two major problems; overcoming the weight of an object by some opposing force, and controlling the object in flight. Both of these problems are related to the object's weight and the location of the center of gravity. The dream remains that, if we could really understand gravity, we could create anti-gravity devices
which would revolutionize travel through the sky. Unfortunately, anti-gravity devices only exist in science fiction. Machines like airplanes, or magnetic levitation devices, create forces opposed to the gravitational force, but they do not block out or eliminate the gravitational force.</p>
